# Spotify Plugin Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Mattermost Spotify plugin from the old codebase to the new template-based structure with enhanced security through status caching.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration (`server/configuration.go`)
- ‚úÖ Added `ClientId` and `ClientSecret` fields to the configuration struct
- ‚úÖ Added Spotify authenticator initialization in `setConfiguration()`
- ‚úÖ Uses modern Mattermost imports (`github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/public/*`)

### 2. Plugin Core (`server/plugin.go`)
- ‚úÖ Added `auth *spotify.Authenticator` field to Plugin struct
- ‚úÖ Updated `OnActivate()` to initialize command handler with plugin reference
- ‚úÖ Removed background job initialization (not needed for Spotify)
- ‚úÖ Added helper methods:
  - `GetSpotifyAuthURL()` - Generates OAuth authorization URL
  - `StoreUserEmail()` - Stores user ID to Spotify email mappings
  - `RemoveUserEmail()` - Removes user's Spotify integration

### 3. API Endpoints (`server/api.go`)
- ‚úÖ Migrated HTTP endpoints with modern routing using `gorilla/mux`
- ‚úÖ Endpoints implemented with **secure caching architecture**:
  - `/callback` - OAuth callback from Spotify (public, no auth required)
  - `/api/v1/me` - Get current user's player status (uses their token, caches result)
  - `/api/v1/status/{userId}` - Get any user's **cached** status (read-only, no token access)
- ‚úÖ Added proper authentication middleware for protected endpoints
- ‚úÖ Implemented token refresh logic (refreshes tokens expiring within 5m30s)
- ‚úÖ **Security Enhancement**: Status caching system
  - Users only access their own Spotify tokens
  - Other users read cached status (no token exposure)
  - Cache expires in 30 seconds if not refreshed

### 4. Commands (`server/command/command.go`)
- ‚úÖ Replaced hello command with Spotify commands
- ‚úÖ Implemented `/spotify enable <email>` command
- ‚úÖ Implemented `/spotify disable` command
- ‚úÖ Added `PluginAPI` interface for dependency injection
- ‚úÖ Added proper autocomplete data for command suggestions

### 5. Tests
- ‚úÖ Updated `server/command/command_test.go` with Spotify command tests
- ‚úÖ Added mock for `PluginAPI` interface
- ‚úÖ Updated `server/plugin_test.go` with basic HTTP tests

### 6. Configuration Schema (`plugin.json`)
- ‚úÖ Updated settings schema with Spotify configuration fields:
  - Client ID field with helpful text
  - Client Secret field with helpful text
  - Added footer with link to Spotify Developer Dashboard

### 7. Cleanup
- ‚úÖ Removed `server/job.go` (background jobs not needed)

### 8. Webapp (`webapp/src/`)
- ‚úÖ Created `manifest.ts` - Plugin metadata exports
- ‚úÖ Created `model.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for Spotify API data
- ‚úÖ Created `action_types.ts` - Redux action type constants
- ‚úÖ Created `reducers.ts` - Redux reducer for Spotify status state
- ‚úÖ Created `StatusComponent.tsx` - User profile popover component showing Spotify status
  - Reads from cached status endpoint (`/api/v1/status/{userId}`)
  - Works for viewing any user's profile
- ‚úÖ Updated `index.tsx` - Main plugin initialization
  - Registers user profile popover component
  - Polls `/api/v1/me` endpoint every 10 seconds for current user's Spotify status
  - Status is automatically cached for others to view
  - Manages Redux state for Spotify playback info
  - **Note**: Removed playback controls (play/pause, next, prev) since command endpoint was removed

## Migration Patterns Applied

### Import Updates

**Server:**
- **Old**: `github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/v5/*`
- **New**: `github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/public/*`

**Webapp:**
- **Old**: `mattermost-redux/types/store`
- **New**: `@mattermost/types/store`

### Structure Improvements

**Server:**
- **Old**: Monolithic plugin.go with all logic
- **New**: Separated concerns:
  - `plugin.go` - Core plugin lifecycle and helpers
  - `api.go` - HTTP endpoint handlers with caching logic
  - `command/` - Command handlers with tests
  - `configuration.go` - Configuration management

**Webapp:**
- **Old**: All components in single file
- **New**: Modular structure:
  - `index.tsx` - Plugin initialization and registration
  - `StatusComponent.tsx` - User profile integration
  - `model.ts` - TypeScript types
  - `reducers.ts` - State management
  - `action_types.ts` - Action constants

### Better Practices
- Using `pluginapi.Client` wrapper for API calls
- Proper middleware pattern for authentication
- Dependency injection for testability
- Modern routing with gorilla/mux
- TypeScript for type safety in webapp
- Redux for state management
- **Secure caching pattern for shared data**

## Security Architecture

### üîí Secure Status Caching

**Problem Solved:**
The original implementation would have allowed any user to trigger API calls using any other user's Spotify OAuth token, which is a significant security and privacy concern.

**Solution:**
1. **Each user fetches their own status** via `/api/v1/me` using their own token
2. **Server caches the status** in KV store with 30-second expiration
3. **Other users read cached status** via `/api/v1/status/{userId}` (no token access)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Secure**: Users only access their own Spotify tokens
- ‚úÖ **Private**: No cross-user token exposure
- ‚úÖ **Fast**: Reading from cache is instant
- ‚úÖ **Rate-limit safe**: Only token owner makes Spotify API calls
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Avoids N√óM problem (N users viewing M profiles)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-cleanup**: Cached status expires if user stops polling

**Data Flow:**
```
User A's Client ‚Üí /api/v1/me (with User A's token)
                ‚Üì
           Spotify API
                ‚Üì
         Cache status in KV
                ‚Üì
User B views profile ‚Üí /api/v1/status/userA (reads cache, no token)
```

## Functional Changes

### Updated Features
- ‚úÖ Users can enable/disable Spotify integration via `/spotify` command
- ‚úÖ OAuth flow for connecting to Spotify
- ‚úÖ **Users can view anyone's Spotify status on their profile** (via secure cache)
- ‚úÖ Automatic status polling every 10 seconds (updates cache)
- ‚úÖ Shows current playing track, artist, and playing state
- ‚úÖ Status auto-expires after 30 seconds if user disconnects/logs out

### Removed Features
- ‚ùå **Removed**: Playback controls (play/pause, next, previous buttons in channel header)
- ‚ùå **Removed**: `ScopeUserModifyPlaybackState` OAuth scope (read-only access only)

## Next Steps

To complete the setup, you need to:

1. **Install server dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Install webapp dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd webapp
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the plugin**:
   ```bash
   make dist
   ```

4. **Configure Spotify Application**:
   - Create an app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Set the redirect URI to: `https://YOUR-MATTERMOST-URL/plugins/com.clearstargroup.cs-mattermost-spotify-plugin/callback`
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

5. **Install and Configure**:
   - Upload the plugin to Mattermost
   - Navigate to System Console ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Clear Star Mattermost Spotify Plugin
   - Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Enable the plugin

## Usage

Once configured, users can:

1. **Enable Spotify**: `/spotify enable their@spotify-email.com`
   - This will redirect them to Spotify for authorization
   - Grants read-only access to their Spotify playback state
2. **Disable Spotify**: `/spotify disable`
   - Removes Spotify integration and clears stored tokens

### User Experience

When a user has enabled Spotify integration:
- **Their own profile**: Status updates every 10 seconds as they poll their status
- **Other users' profiles**: Status is read from cache (refreshed every 10 seconds by the profile owner)
- Shows one of:
  - "Spotify: Not connected" - User hasn't enabled integration or cache expired
  - "Spotify: Not playing" - User is connected but not currently playing music
  - "Spotify Playing: [Song Name] by [Artist]" - User is actively playing music

### Privacy Notes

- Your Spotify OAuth token is **never** exposed to other users
- Other users can only see your **cached status** (not access your account)
- Status cache expires in 30 seconds if you stop using Mattermost
- Only you can make API calls to Spotify on your behalf

## API Endpoints for Frontend

- `GET /plugins/com.clearstargroup.cs-mattermost-spotify-plugin/api/v1/me` - Get current user's player state (requires auth, uses user's token, caches result)
- `GET /plugins/com.clearstargroup.cs-mattermost-spotify-plugin/api/v1/status/{userId}` - Get any user's cached player state (requires auth, read-only from cache)

All API endpoints require Mattermost authentication (automatically handled by Mattermost-User-ID header).
